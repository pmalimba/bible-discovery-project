          <h3>The Revelation that Jesus is Lord</h3>
          <p>
            God spoke to His children through 66 books, 1,189 chapters and 31,102 verses.
            By this means, He imparted His will, blessings, favours, and promises on His people.
            Most importantly, He shared the knowledge of the spiritual laws and principles that
            rule and govern His Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            With 5 billion copies sold worldwide, the Holy Bible is the best-selling book in
            history. Though written centuries ago, it still holds truths and wisdom that billion
            of Christians follow and rely on for guidance in their daily lives. The Bible is the
            revelation that Jesus is Lord.

              <h4 id="king-david">King David</h4>
              <p>
                The man after God's heart. David was barely a teenager and a goat herder
                when Prophet Samuel anointed him future King of Israel.

              </p>
              <h5>Why is he important?</h5>
              <p>
                Blessed with extraordinary courage and confidence, King David went through it all.
                He delighted in the fastuous strass and glamour of royal priviledge,
                but also sank in the throes of loneliness and desperation after falling
                out of favour with the Lord due to his sinful nature.
              </p>
              <h5>What have I leaned</h5>
              <p>
                King David blindly trusted and feared the Lord in every circumstances. The presence of God in
                his life was the only thing that ever mattered. He accepted the punishment
                for falling out of Grace, but begged for the presence of God to never depart
                from him.

              <h4>Mary of Nazareth</h4>
              <p>
                A betrothed teenager received from Angel Gabriel the annunciation
                of the virgin birth that changed the world.
              </p>
              <h5>Why is she important?</h5>
              <p>
                In those days, to carry a pregancy out of wedlock was sanctioned by capital punishment.
                Let alone the shame and disgrace that would taint the family name forever. The odds
                lined up in her favour and God's plan got carried out.

              </p>
              <h5>What have I leaned</h5>
              <p>
                Shrouded in endless blessing and favour, Mary carried her pregnancy with Grace
                and determination. God handpicked her for her blind faith, humility, courage, and
                faithfulness. She became the Mother of the Messiah. The Mother of God.

              <h4>Ruth</h4>
              <p>
                A newly-bereaved young woman declines to return to her family and vows
                to stay with her aging and deprived mother-in-law.

              </p>
              <h5>Why is she important?</h5>
              <p>
                Through her hardships, Ruth met Boaz. They got married and had Obed who fathered
                Jesse, the father of King David. In the lineage of our Lord and Saviour Jesus.
                A single act of kindness can go a long way and brew miracles.
              </p>
              <h5>What have I leaned</h5>
              <p>
                When loyalty coupled to obedience meet resilience, miracles happen. Ruth's only care
                was the wellbeing of her mother-in-law. She worked day and night to supply to her needs.
                And God rewarded her beyond anything she could have imagined.
