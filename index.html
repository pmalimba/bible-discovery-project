            God spoke to His children trhough 66 books, 1,189 chapters and 31,102 verses.
            By this means He imparted His will, blessings, favours, promises on His people
            and mostly shared the knowledge of the spiritual laws and principles that
            rule and govern His Kingdom.

            With 5 billion copies sold worldwide, the Holy Bible is the best-selling book in
            history. Though written centuries ago, it still holds truths and wisdom that billion
            of Christians follow and rely on for guidance in their daily lives. The Bible is the
